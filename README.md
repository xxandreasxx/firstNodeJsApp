# My first NodeJs Application!

This is my first NodeJs application where i learn the fundamentals to create a full stack app

### First step
At first i learned how to connect MySql database to the nodeJs app via a 'pool'. Created a simple database with users and teams. 
Made some basic functions to collect the database data and pass it to ExpressJs.

Finally i added a .env file to keep my database information private.
